# Loan Classification Project
The aim of this project is to explore the possibility of classifying the credit loans into two categories, namely, the good and the bad loans based on the LendingClub loan data. 

First, note that:
- the files containing the actual loan data are too big for upload but can be downloaded at this site:

- the file LCDataDictionary.xlsx comes from this site: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data

## Short Description##
The whole process is divided into 4 Jupyter notebooks with pretty much self-explanatory names. The first two notebooks are devoted to the process of selecting, preparing and cleaning the data as well as removing the potential data leaks and selecting the suitable initial list of potential predictors. The third notebook contains the exploratory data analysis of the chosen and engineered features. Finally, the fourth notebook incorporates the **feature engineering** ideas presented during the exploratory analysis phase and includes the classification model training and selection (via the **cross-validation** procedure).

## More Detailed Description##
Since the notebooks are well commented, we refrain from delving deeper into the minute details of the work done in the first three notebooks. The interested reader is encouraged to have a glance or two at their contents. We will, on the other hand, concentrate on the main part of the fourth notebook, namely, on the model training and selection.
